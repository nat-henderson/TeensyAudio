# TeensyAudio

Given an audio input to a Teensy 3.1 and 8 relays as outputs, control the 8 relays directly based on the music: 4 relays based on presence / absence of substantial low / mid-low / mid-high / high tones, and 4 relays based on volume (1 for quiet, 2 for middling, 3 for loud, 4 for very loud).
